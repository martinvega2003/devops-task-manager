# DevOps Task Manager

## Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack task management application** built with **React.js, TailwindCSS, Express.js, and PostgreSQL**, focused on **DevOps best practices, AWS deployment, and CI/CD automation**. Users can create, manage, and assign tasks while utilizing real-world infrastructure tools like **Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS services**.

## Core Features

- ✅ **User Authentication** (JWT-based login & signup)
- ✅ **Task Management** (CRUD operations for tasks)
- ✅ **Task Assignment** (Users can assign tasks to others)
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** (Admins have additional privileges)
- ✅ **Task Prioritization** (Users can set priorities & deadlines)
- ✅ **Real-Time Monitoring & Logging** (CloudWatch integration)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-task-manager.git
   cd devops-task-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   For the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   For the backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `server` directories, and include the necessary API keys, JWT secrets, and other configurations.

4. **Start the frontend and backend**:
   - In the `client` folder, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - In the `server` folder, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

This project follows a **Git Flow-like** branching strategy:
- `main`: Stable, production-ready code.
- `dev`: Ongoing development branch, all features and fixes are merged here.
- `feature/branch-name`: A new branch created from `dev` for each new feature or task.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- **Short, descriptive summary** (max 50 characters).
- **Detailed description** (optional), explaining why the change was made and any relevant context.

**Example**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add CRUD functionality for tasks"
```

### Pull Request (PR) Process

1. Create a new feature branch from `dev` (e.g., `feature/task-crud`).
2. Push your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/task-crud
   ```
3. Create a PR from the feature branch to `dev`.
4. PR description should explain the purpose and scope of the changes.
5. Once reviewed and approved, merge the PR into `dev`.
